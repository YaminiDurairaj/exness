            <p class="my-4">CFDs are complex derivative products which are traded outside an exchange. These products
                come with a
                high risk of
                losing money rapidly due to leverage
                and thus are not appropriate for all investors.</p>

            <p class="my-4"> *The term "instant" indicates that a transaction is carried out within a few seconds
                without manual
                processing by
                financial department specialists. This does not guarantee that a deposit and withdrawal will be
                completed
                instantaneously, but that the process is begun instantly. Processing times depend entirely on the
                payment method chosen.</p>
